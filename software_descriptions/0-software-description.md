# Software Description Index

This document lists all current feature and implementation plans for the Rulette project.

## Commands commonly for development:
- `npm install -g firebase-tools`: Install the Firebase CLI globally.
- `npx serve .`: Start a local development server to test the software (assuming static files in the root).

## Deployment instructions:
1. Ensure you have the Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`).
2. Authenticate with Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Initialize your project for Firebase: `firebase init` (Select Hosting and follow the prompts)
4. Build your project (if necessary, e.g., `npm run build`).
5. Deploy to Firebase Hosting: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

## ConOps

### Mission
Create a digital party/card game where players spin a wheel to receive and follow quirky rules, with social enforcement and referee judgment. Rulette is designed to be a fun, dynamic, and highly replayable experience for groups, blending chance, creativity, and social interaction.

### Opportunity
"ok fine, I'll make a game with you"

### Identification of Competition
- Jackbox Party Pack: Focuses on trivia and drawing, lacks persistent rule stacking and referee mechanics ([jackboxgames.com](https://jackboxgames.com))
- Uno Online: Classic card play, but no custom rules or referee ([uno.fandom.com](https://uno.fandom.com))
- Cards Against Humanity Online: Static rules, no dynamic rule changes or referee ([cardsagainsthumanity.com](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com))
- Most digital party games: Do not offer a wheel mechanic, referee role, or card transfer system.

### Users
- Party game fans and friend groups seeking a new digital experience
- Streamers and online communities looking for interactive content
- Casual gamers who enjoy social, creative, and improvisational play

### Operation
1. Players join a game session and are assigned 20 points each.
2. One player is randomly assigned the "referee" card.
3. On their turn, a player spins the wheel.
4. The wheel lands on a card type: new rule, rule modifier, flip, swap, clone, or prompt.
5. The player draws the card and must follow the rule or action described.
6. If a player fails to follow a rule, another player may call them out.
7. The referee judges the callout:
    - If the call is valid, the failed player loses a point, the caller gains a point, and may transfer one of their cards to the failed player.
    - If not, no penalty is applied.
8. The referee card itself can be swapped if a swap card is drawn.
9. A player may use a flip card to change the active rule or effect of a card they hold.
10. Play continues until a win or end condition is met (to be defined).

### General Features
- Wheel spin mechanic to determine card type
- Multiple card types: new rule, rule modifier, swap, clone, prompt, flip
- Persistent and stackable rules for ongoing gameplay variety
- Referee system for social enforcement and judgment
- Points system with card transfer on successful callouts
