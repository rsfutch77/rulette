# Plan 8: Real-Time Synchronization

**Phase:** 3 â€” Multiplayer and Lobby System  
**Story Points:** 14

---

## Objective

Implement real-time synchronization of game state and player actions across all clients, ensuring a seamless and consistent multiplayer experience.

---

## Tasks

### 8.1 State Sync Architecture (4 points)
- Design a system for broadcasting game state changes to all connected clients.
- Choose appropriate technology (e.g., WebSockets, Firebase Realtime Database).

### 8.2 Action Propagation (3 points)
- Ensure all player actions (spins, card draws, callouts, etc.) are propagated in real time.
- Handle out-of-order or conflicting actions gracefully.

### 8.3 Latency and Consistency Handling (3 points)
- Minimize latency for all real-time updates.
- Implement conflict resolution and state reconciliation as needed.

### 8.4 Connection Management (2 points)
- Detect and handle dropped or lagging connections.
- Allow players to reconnect and resync their state.

### 8.5 Testing and Debugging Tools (2 points)
- Provide tools for testing synchronization and debugging state issues.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All game state changes and player actions are reflected in real time for all clients.
- Latency is minimal and does not disrupt gameplay.
- Disconnected players can reconnect and resync without data loss.
- System is robust against conflicts and edge cases.

---

## Dependencies

- Plan 7: Lobby and Player Join/Leave

---

## Out of Scope

- Analytics or advanced monitoring (covered in later plans).
- UI/UX polish beyond functional synchronization.
