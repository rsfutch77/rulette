# Plan 6: Multiplayer Session Management

**Phase:** 3 â€” Multiplayer and Lobby System  
**Story Points:** 16

---

## Objective

Implement robust multiplayer session management, allowing players to create, join, and leave sessions seamlessly, with real-time updates and session persistence.

---

## Tasks

### 6.1 Session Creation and Join Logic (4 points)
- Allow players to create new multiplayer sessions with unique codes or links.
- Enable players to join existing sessions using a code or invitation.

### 6.2 Player Management (4 points)
- Track all players in a session, including their status (active, disconnected, left).
- Handle player disconnects and reconnections gracefully.

### 6.3 Session State Management (3 points)
- Maintain and synchronize session state (lobby, in-game, completed) across all clients.
- Ensure session state persists if the host disconnects.

### 6.4 Session Termination and Cleanup (3 points)
- Allow sessions to be ended by the host or automatically when all players leave.
- Clean up session data to prevent orphaned sessions.

### 6.5 Security and Access Control (2 points)
- Prevent unauthorized access to sessions.
- Handle edge cases such as duplicate player names or session hijacking.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Players can reliably create, join, and leave sessions.
- Session state is synchronized and persists across disconnects.
- Player management is robust and handles all edge cases.
- Sessions are secure and cleaned up when finished.

---

## Dependencies

- Plan 5: Points and Card Transfer System

---

## Out of Scope

- Real-time game synchronization (covered in next plan).
- UI/UX polish beyond functional session management.
